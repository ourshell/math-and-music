# Math and Music: Exploring Undiscovered Possibilities

## Introduction
This project explores mathematical concepts in music. Every topic here is a result of discussions with ChatGPT.

## [Near-Equal Temperament](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/net.md)
Theoretical approach how to achieve equal intervals by a stack of just intervals. Check [net.md](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/net.md)
The draft has been written in early 2015 and was updated over the years. Checkout the [origin](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/tree/main/origin) folder or [draft](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/origin/Near-Equal%20Temperament.pdf).

## [Higher-Dimensional Sound](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/higher-dimensional-sound.md)
Explore the possibility of generating a sound in the fourth dimension. Its projection into our three-dimensional space could manifest as a sound with incredibly colorful tones and unimaginable timbre, unlike anything heard before.

## Drafts
I asked AI to fork my projects and develop extended versions of these theories. But generated something completely delusional, inaccurate and ridiculous. They are so fundamentally wrong.
