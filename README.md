# Math and Music: Exploring Undiscovered Possibilities

## Introduction
This project explores mathematical concepts in music. Every topic here is a result of discussions with ChatGPT.

## [Near-Equal Temperament](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/net.md)
Theoretical approach how to achieve equal intervals by a stack of just intervals. Check [net.md](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/net.md)
The draft has been written in early 2015 and was updated over the years. Checkout the [origin](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/tree/main/origin) folder or [draft](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/origin/Near-Equal%20Temperament.pdf).

## [Extended Harmonic Coherence Temperament (EHCT)](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/ehct.md)
This article is a forked theory of the [Near-Equal Temperament](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/net.md), generated by ChatGPT. It's completely inaccurate, imaginary and ridiculous. I have decided to upload it anyway although it has zero practical implementation. Check [ehct.md](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/ehct.md)
