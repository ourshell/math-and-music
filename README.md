# Math and Music: Exploring Undiscovered Possibilities

## Introduction
This project explores mathematical concepts in music. Every topic here is a result of discussions with ChatGPT.

## [Near-Equal Temperament](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/net.md)
Theoretical approach how to achieve equal intervals by a stack of just intervals. Check [net.md](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/net.md)

## [Extended Harmonic Coherence Temperament (EHCT)](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/ehct.md)
This article is a forked theory of the Near-Equal Temperament. Completely generated by ChatGPT, imaginary and ridiculous. Check [ehct.md](https://github.com/ourshell/math-and-music/blob/main/ehct.md)
