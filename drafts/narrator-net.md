In the last three centuries, the purity of music has remained unchanged. Since then, we have used Equal Temperament, a system based on dividing the octave into 12 equal parts using logarithmic intervals. Though often associated with Johann Sebastian Bach, its origins lie in the work of 17th and 18th century theorists, such as Andreas Werckmeister. Unfortunately, this system sacrifices the natural purity of intervals to achieve equal spacing of tones.

Over the centuries, many theories have emerged to restore purity to music. Our approach builds on these ideas by revisiting the Just Intonation system, where the perfect fifth resonates as a 3:2 ratio and the major third as 5:4. In Equal Temperament, the fifth is bent, the third strained, and the harmony subtly distorted.

We introduce Near-Equal Temperament, a new system that combines the strengths of both approaches. By stacking seven perfect fifths and one major third, then folding them into a single octave, we achieve an astonishing precision. The difference melts to a mere -0.0013 cents, far below the threshold of human perception.

This new design offers the best of both worlds, nearly pure intervals within an unbreakable structure, creating music that is both flexible and harmonious.
