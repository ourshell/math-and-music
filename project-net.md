Near-Equal Temperament: A Complete Analysis

Introduction

In acoustics, the accuracy of Equal Temperament (ET) has always been compromised, affecting the quality of sound. To address this, a new theory called Near-Equal Temperament (N-ET) has been developed. The core of N-ET is a stack of just intervalsâ€”7 perfect fifths (3/2) and 1 major third (5/4). While the process of manual tuning is time-consuming, the mathematical precision of true Equal Temperament can be achieved with unconditional accuracy, a feat never accomplished before. This article explores the theory of N-ET through music theory, mathematics, and acoustics.

1. Sound Perception (Pitch)

The ability to distinguish between two frequencies is not linear. For example, increasing the frequency of A4 = 440 Hz by 50% results in 660 Hz, but the perceived pitch increase is not proportional. This is due to the exponential relationship between pitch and frequency.

To increase the pitch by 50% (a factor of ), the frequency must be calculated as:

```math
F = 440 \times 2^{\frac{1}{2}} = 440 \times \sqrt{2} = 440 \times 1.4142135623731 \approx 622 \text{ Hz}
```

In ET, frequencies are calculated to divide the octave into 12 equally spaced tones as perceived by the human ear. The ratio for each tone is given by:

```math
\text{Ratio}_n = 2^{\frac{n}{12}}, \quad n = 0, 1, \dots, 11
```

2. Linear Representation

Intervals in a musical scale are measured in cents, a logarithmic unit that linearizes pitch changes. The formula for pitch difference in cents is:

```math
\text{Pitch} = 1200 \times \frac{\ln(f_2 \div f_1)}{\ln(2)} = 1200 \times \frac{\ln(Ratio_2 \div Ratio_1)}{\ln(2)} = 1200 \times \frac{\ln(Ratio)}{\ln(2)}
```

For example, in ET, a semitone (100 cents) is calculated as:

```math
\text{Pitch}_{\text{semitone}} = 1200 \times \frac{\ln(2^{\frac{1}{12}})}{\ln(2)} = 1200 \times \frac{0.05776226504}{0.69314718056} \approx 100 \text{ cents}
```

Similarly, a whole tone (200 cents) between two tones is:

```math
\text{Pitch}_{\text{whole-tone}} = 1200 \times \frac{\ln(2^{\frac{7}{12}} \div 2^{\frac{5}{12}})}{\ln(2)} = 200 \text{ cents}
```

3. Just Noticeable Difference (JND)

The Just Noticeable Difference (JND) defines the smallest pitch change perceivable by the human ear. In the range of 80 Hz to 500 Hz, JND is approximately 1 Hz for complex sounds. For example:

```math
\text{JND}_1 = 1200 \times \frac{\ln(500 / 499)}{\ln(2)} \approx 3.465935 \text{ cents}
```

For harmonic intervals, such as the syntonic comma (81/80), the difference is:

```math
\text{JND}_2 = 1200 \times \frac{\ln(81 / 80)}{\ln(2)} \approx 21.5063 \text{ cents}
```

Pitch changes below 3.5 cents are imperceptible, which becomes critical when comparing tuning systems.

4. Tuning Systems Comparison

Perfect Fifths (P5)

In ET, the ratio of a perfect fifth is approximated as:

```math
\text{Ratio}_{\text{P5, ET}} = 2^{7/12} \approx 1.498307
```

In Just Intonation (JI), the perfect fifth is:

```math
\text{Ratio}_{\text{P5, JI}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5
```

The difference in cents is:

```math
\text{Difference} = 1200 \times \ln(2^{7/12} / (3/2)) / \ln(2) \approx -1.955 \text{ cents}
```

5. Ratios Relationship

Within an octave, the most harmonic chord is the major triad, consisting of:

Major third (M3): 

Perfect fifth (P5): 

The deviation of M3 and P5 in ET compared to JI is calculated as:

```math
\text{Error}_{\text{M3}} = 1200 \times \ln(5/4) / \ln(2) - 400 \approx -13.686 \text{ cents}
```

```math
\text{Error}_{\text{P5}} = 1200 \times \ln(3/2) / \ln(2) - 700 \approx +1.955 \text{ cents}
```
These deviations are critical for harmonic purity.

Stacking Intervals

By stacking 7 P5s and 1 M3, a near-perfect interval is achieved. The formula for the stack is:

```math
\text{Stack} = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^7 \times \frac{5}{4} \times \frac{1}{2^4}
```

Simplifying:

```math
\text{Stack} = \frac{10935}{8192} \approx 1.334839
```

Compared to ET:

```math
\text{Ratio}_{\text{P4, ET}} = 2^{5/12} \approx 1.334839
```

The error in cents is:

```math
\text{Error}_{\text{stack}} = 1200 \times \ln(1.334839) / \ln(2) - 500 \approx -0.0013 \text{ cents}
```

6. Near-Equal Intervals

The stack can be iteratively applied to generate all 12 tones in the scale. The formula for each ratio is:

```math
\text{NER}_n = \left(\frac{10935}{8192}\right)^n, \quad n = 0, 1, \dots, 11
```

Ratios exceeding 2 are divided by 2 to stay within the octave. The worst cumulative error is:

```math
\text{Cumulative Error} = 11 \times -0.0013 \approx -0.014 \text{ cents}
```

7. Practical Applications

N-ET achieves unprecedented precision, with errors far below the JND threshold. This makes it suitable for:

Acoustic instruments, ensuring harmonic purity.

Digital synthesizers, where computational precision can replicate N-ET ratios.

8. Conclusion

Near-Equal Temperament offers a revolutionary approach to tuning, combining the harmonic purity of Just Intonation with the flexibility of Equal Temperament. By leveraging precise interval stacking, N-ET overcomes traditional tuning limitations and achieves near-perfect harmony. Future research could explore its application to microtonal systems and ensemble tuning, revolutionizing musical acoustics.
